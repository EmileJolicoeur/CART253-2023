# Exercise: Dodge-em!

After following the instructions of the Covid19 activity, I decided to go for a space themed dodge-em game where the player would
need to traverse through an endless asteroid shower, dodging as many space rocks as possible without getting hit.

After adding acceleration and speed to the asteroids and player, I created a hud which displays the seconds the player survived and
the amount of asteroids they have dodged. Finally, I implemented my own textures for the ship and the asteroids.
